# CSIS 166 - Lab 2

In this lab, you will be using the Stack_8e emulator and code to write a program that creates a 4-function integer calculator. The calculator will clear variable M and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on that variable.

## Program Requirements

- Create a 4-function integer calculator.
- The calculator should clear variable M and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Sample interaction:

    ```
    Enter c, +, -, q: c
    M is: 0

    Enter c, +, -, q: +
    Number? 124
    M is: 124

    Enter c, +, -, q: -
    Number? 3
    M is: 121

    Enter c, +, -, q: q
    Done!
    ```

- Use the ioroutines for input and output of decimal numbers.
- Implement a subroutine to prompt the user and input the number.

## Instructions

1. Use the Stack_8e emulator and provided code to implement the calculator program.
2. Make sure to handle the clearing of variable M and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. Utilize the ioroutines for input and output of decimal numbers.
4. Implement a subroutine to prompt the user and input the number.

## Extra Credit

For an additional 10 points, add the functionality for multiplication and division using the MQ register.

## Submission
