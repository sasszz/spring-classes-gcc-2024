# Lab 5 EC - Ruby

15 pts e.c.

## Directions

Ruby is an object oriented scripting language in which you can create classes. You can run Ruby either via compileonline, or go to this website to either download and/or run Ruby (MacOSX or Linux just use a shell and enter the command irb to get into Ruby interactively … enter “quit” to get out of Ruby).

Create a third class called Birthday that will take a name and an age. Then have the following methods:
happy_bday
That will print the name and print “happy Birthday”, the name, and the age
retire
That will print the number of years until retirement (Assume 65 is retirement age)
set_age
That will allow you to change the age
Submit the class.
