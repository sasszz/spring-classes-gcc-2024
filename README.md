# 166 ADVANCED COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE AND ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE

**3.0 Units**

CS/IS 166 covers the extension of basic addressing concepts to more advanced addressability such as base register and self-relative addressing, as well as comparative computer architecture focusing on such organizations as multiple register processors and stack machines. Students study the basics of virtual memory input-output and an introduction to the concept of micro programmable systems. Low-level system translation processes associated with assemblers, system functions such as relocatable loading and memory management, applications of data structures, and hashing techniques are covered. Lecture 3 hours.

**Prerequisite:** CS/IS 165 or equivalent.

**Course Typically Offered:** Spring (Every Other Year).

**Transfer Credit:** CSU, UC, USC.
